1. Setting Up When the Page Loads
●	The code starts by waiting for the entire page to load using DOMContentLoaded. This ensures all the HTML elements are ready before the JavaScript starts working.
2. Creating a New Post
●	Form Submission: When you fill out the form with a title, content, and category and click submit, the createPost function is triggered.
●	Create Post: This function makes a new post object that includes a unique ID, title, content, category, number of likes, comments, and whether it has been edited.
●	Save Post: The new post is saved in the browser's local storage (a place where your browser can save data that doesn't disappear when you close the page).
●	Display Post: The post is then displayed on the page.
3. Saving and Getting Posts from Storage
●	Save to Storage: The savePostsToStorage function saves the list of posts to local storage so that they are not lost when you refresh the page.
●	Get from Storage: The getPostsFromStorage function retrieves the saved posts from local storage when the page loads.
4. Displaying Posts
●	Show Posts: The displayPosts function shows all posts on the page by creating a new HTML element for each post and adding it to the list.
5. Post Actions
●	Like Button: Each post has a like button. When you click it, the like count toggles between 0 and 1, and the post updates.
●	Edit Content: There's an "Edit-Blog" button. When clicked, it allows you to edit the post's content. After editing, you can save the changes, and the post is marked as edited.
●	Delete Post: If you want to delete a post, you can click the "Delete-Blog" button. It will ask for confirmation, and if you agree, the post is removed from the list and storage.
6. Comments
●	Show/Hide Comments: There's a button to toggle the visibility of the comments section for each post.
●	Add Comment: You can add a comment to a post by typing in the comment box and clicking the "Comment" button.
●	Edit Comment: Each comment has an "Edit" button. You can click it to modify the comment and save the changes.
●	Delete Comment: Similarly, you can delete a comment by clicking the "Delete" button next to it.
7. Search Posts
●	Search Functionality: There's a search box at the top. When you type something in it, the posts list updates to only show posts that match the search query.
8. Loading Posts Initially
●	Initial Display: When the page first loads, the posts stored in local storage are displayed automatically.
This setup allows users to create, edit, delete, like, and comment on blog posts, with all data saved in the browser so it can be accessed even after refreshing the page. The search function helps find specific posts by title.
